In the article REF, we study the behavior of the efficiency at the maximum power of a quantum dot molecule, acting as a device for photovoltaic conversion. We follow a theoretical approach using a master equation, considering the effect of the energy offsets, and the width of the quantum barrier, identifying realistic physical conditions that enhance the photovoltaic response of the photocell. This document contains the code to generate the reported numerical data.
